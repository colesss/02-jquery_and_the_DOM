#### Single-line Summary
**Today, _ and _ paired together. It took about _**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on ...
   /*TODO: Include any/all needed script tags.*/
   Added a script tag for article.js, blogArticle.js, and jquery.js, putting the jquery.js tag first.

  2. Next, we worked on...
  /*TODO: Use the JS object passed in to complete this constructor function:
  Save ALL the properties of `rawDataObj` into `this`*/
  Added the following properties to the Article constructor: title, category, author, authorUrl, publishedOn, and body.

  3. Then we did ...
  /*TODO: This cloned article still has a class of template.
  However, in our modules.css stylesheet, we gave all elements
  with a class of template a display of none. Let's make
  sure we're not accidentally hiding our cloned article!*/
  Added a removeClass method to the variable $newArticle targeting the class template.

  4. Finally we ...
  /*TODO: Now use jQuery traversal and setter methods to fill in the rest
  of the current template clone with properties from this particular Article instance.
  We need to fill in:

    1. author name,
    2. author url,
    3. article title,
    4. article body, and
    5. publication date.*/
